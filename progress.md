# 🌌 GravitySim Development Journal

This project is a simple but educational simulation of gravitational physics using Python and `matplotlib` for visualization.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

I wanted to improve my understanding of physics simulations and object-oriented Python. It also supports my long-term goal of combining simulation and reinforcement learning with blockchain systems.

## 🧠 What I Did On My Own

- Implemented the `Body` class and gravitational force calculation
- Set up time-stepping and updates for position and velocity
- Used `matplotlib` to animate the motion of bodies in 2D
- Structured the code into a clear loop with force accumulation and updates

## 🤝 What I Did With ChatGPT

- Refactored the code to make it more modular and readable
- Improved physics stability and handling of overlapping bodies
- Got help designing a cleaner animation setup with `matplotlib.animation`
- Learned better commenting and debugging techniques

## 🧩 What I Learned

- How to calculate gravitational forces using Newton’s law
- Vector math with NumPy
- Animating real-time simulations with `matplotlib`
- Structuring simulations cleanly using object-oriented principles

## 📈 Future Ideas

- Add collision detection or body merging
- Let users configure number of bodies and initial states
- Improve animation clarity (e.g., trails, different colors for mass)
