# 🌌 GravitySim – A Gravitational Physics Simulation in Python

This is a basic 2D simulation that shows gravitational attraction between multiple bodies, based on Newton's law of universal gravitation. Built in Python using `matplotlib` for animation.

Some parts were done independently, while others were developed with help from ChatGPT to improve design, accuracy, and code readability.

## 🧠 Features

- Simulates gravitational forces in 2D space
- Animated using `matplotlib.animation`
- Real-time updates of body positions and velocities
- Clean, object-oriented structure

## 🏗️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
